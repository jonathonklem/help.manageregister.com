# Role

Role Management allows you to control what different types of users can see and do within the system.

---

## 🎯 What Roles Are

Roles are permission groups. You can create roles like:

- Manager
- Front Desk
- Instructor
- Owner

Each role can have specific permissions that control access to different parts of the system.

---

## ➕ Creating a Role

When creating a new role, you'll:

- **Name the role** (e.g., "Manager")
- **Choose web app permissions** from a list

Permissions are shown in an easy-to-use checklist. You can search or bulk-select as needed.

---

## 📝 Editing a Role

To edit a role:

1. Click on the role from the list
2. Change its name or permissions
3. Save your changes

Only users with the right access can update roles.

---

## 📋 Role List

The roles page shows a list of all existing roles. You can:

- View role names
- Search and sort the list
- Edit any existing role

---

## 🗑 Bulk Actions

You can delete multiple roles at once using the bulk delete option.

> ⚠️ Deleting a role does not remove users assigned to it, but it will remove their access permissions unless reassigned.
