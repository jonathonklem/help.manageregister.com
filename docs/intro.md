# Getting Started

Welcome to ManageRegister! Follow this quick setup guide to get your system ready for accurate inventory and sales tracking.

## 1. Configure General Settings

Start by setting up your business profile:

- Go to **Settings > General**.
- In the **About** section, set your **Business Type** and **Currency**.
- Then switch to the **Profile** section and set your **Timezone**.

Accurate settings here ensure your reports and logs reflect the correct time and financial format.

## 2. Set Up Categories

Before adding products, it's helpful to create one or more **Categories**. This allows you to group products for better organization and filtering.

- Go to **Inventory > Categories** to add your categories.

## 3. Add Products

Once categories are set:

- Navigate to **Inventory > Products**.
- Add each product, assigning it to a category and setting its details (name, price, etc).

## 4. Document Purchases (Do Not Manually Edit Quantity)

To increase product stock levels, **do not manually edit the quantity field**. Instead:

- Go to **Inventory > Purchases**.
- Log each new stock purchase there, selecting the product and entering the quantity and purchase details.

⚠️ This is important: **Only documenting purchases ensures accurate stock history, cost tracking, and inventory reporting**. Manually changing quantities will result in incorrect inventory levels and broken reports.
