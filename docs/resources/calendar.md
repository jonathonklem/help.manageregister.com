# Calendar

The Calendar provides a visual scheduling interface for booking resources, classes, and events. It integrates with ManageMemberships to show availability and handle reservations.

---

## Using the Calendar

1. Go to **Resources > Calendar**.
2. You'll see a calendar view showing available time slots for each resource.
3. Click and drag on a time range to start a new booking.

---

## Moving and Editing Bookings

Drag a booking to move it, drag its edge to change its length, or click it to edit or delete it. Moving a booking that came from a quote updates the quote too.

Users whose role lacks `manage range bookings` (such as RSO) can view the calendar and open bookings, but can't create, move, edit or delete them.

---

## Blocked Time and Privacy

To block a resource, select a time range and click **Mark Resource Unavailable**, then enter a reason (e.g. "ATF TRAINING"). To remove a block, click it and confirm.

Who sees the reason depends on their role:

| Tier | What they see | Default roles |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Visible** | "Unavailable - ATF TRAINING" | MORSS, Manager, admin, staff |
| **Click to reveal** | "Unavailable". Clicking the block offers **Show** | Front Desk |
| **Hidden** | "Unavailable" only | RSO, Receipt Counter |

Members never see the reason. To hide reasons from ManageMemberships staff as well, turn on **Hide Unavailable Reasons From Staff** in ManageMemberships under Portal Settings > Privacy & Access.

Change who sees what on the [Roles](../user/roles) screen.

## Tips

- Review the calendar daily to stay on top of upcoming bookings and blocked time.
- Make sure resources are configured and active on ManageMemberships for them to appear here.
